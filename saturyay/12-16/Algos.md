## Bubble Sort
Write a program to sort an array of numbers in ascending order, comparing and swapping two numbers at a time.

    [3, 1, 4, 2]
    [1, 3, 4, 2]
    [1, 3, 4, 2]
    [1, 3, 2, 4]
    [1, 3, 2, 4]
    [1, 2, 3, 4]

## Word Scramble

Given a string and an integer array indices of the same length.
The strings will be shuffled such that the character at the i'n n'th position moves to indices[i] in the shuffled string.
Return the shuffled string.

    string = “odce” 
    indices = [1, 2, 0, 3]
    Returns “code"

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that takes an integer and outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to n (the input integer).

For multiples of 3 it should output “Fizz” instead of the number.
For the multiples of 5 output “Buzz” 
For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5 output “FizzBuzz”

    input = 16
    output display=
    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz
    Fizz
    7
    8
    Fizz
    Buzz
    11
    Fizz
    13
    14
    FizzBuzz
    16
